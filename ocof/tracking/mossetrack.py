    Using the Tracker
    =================
      I{Note: A working example of tracking can be found in the C{src/examples/}
      directory.}
    
      Tracking is initialized using a frame of the video and a rectangle which 
      specifies the target to be tracked.  The interface to the tracker is 
      intended to be  simple to use, but there are still many optional 
      configuration options that allows tracking to be tuned to different 
      scenarios.
      
      The first step is to import the pyvision and ocof libraries::
      
        import pyvision as pv
        import ocof
    
      A track is initialized on creation by providing a frame (pv.Image) and a rectangle (pv.Rect), which 
      specifies the target to be tracked::
    
        track = ocof.MOSSETrack(frame,rect)
    
      For each additional from the track is updated by calling the method L{update}::
    
        track.update(frame)
      
    Using the Tracking Output
    =========================
      To find the location of the track in each following frame the following
      methods can be called to get points and rectangles in PyVision format::
      
        pt = track.asPoint()
        rect = track.asRect()
        
      These values can then be rendered on the frame or used by following
      processing steps::

        frame.annotatePoint(pt)
        frame.annotateRect(rect)
    
      As a convenience there is also a method that will annotate a frame with 
      diagnostics information such as timing data, the PSR, track location,
      and images of the input, filter, and output.  This additional information
      can prove valuable in understanding and correcting challenges encountered
      by the tracker::
      
        track.annotateFrame(frame)
        
      One of the most common things to do with the output of the tracker is
      to obtain a cropped tile representing the tracking rectangle.  This can 
      be done easily using the PyVision affine transform utilities.  In this
      example, C{crop} is an instance of an affine transform class that can be
      called like a function on images and points::
        
        crop = pv.AffineFromRect(rect,(64,64))
        tile = crop(frame)
        

    Tips, Tricks, and Performance Tuning
    ====================================
      This section will cover some tips and tricks for obtaining good 
      performance with the tracker.  While MOSSE based visual tracking is one
      of the best algorithms available, there are some simple thing that can
      be done in order to achieve the best tracking performance.
      
      B{Know Your Target}
      
      Before tracking it is important to understand the characteristics of the
      target.  It is a good idea to answer these questions.
      
        1. How quickly does the target change its location in the frame?
        2. How quickly does a target change its appearance due to scale 
           changes, rotations, or deformations?
        3. What parts of the target have the most consistent appearance?
        4. What external factors may cause tracking difficulties? Lighting? 
           Shadows? Occlusions? etc.
        5. What are the highest contrast "edges" within the target or on its 
           boundary? 
        6. How will the target move?  Will it change size as it gets closer or
           further from the camera?  Does the target perform out-of-plane 
           rotations? Does the target perform in-plane rotations? 

      First, consider these two target types: people and vehicles.  People are 
      very difficult targets to track for a few reasons.  The biggest reason for
      this is because the persons appearance changes as they move.  As a person
      walks the swing there arms and legs which makes those body parts useless 
      for visual tracking.  Additionally, a person can turn very quickly.  This
      means that one moment the camera could be viewing the front of a person 
      a few frames later it may be viewing the back of the person.  In order to
      track a person, the tracker will need to adapt quickly to the changes in
      appearance. 
      
      A vehicle, on the other hand, is one of the easiest targets to track.  
      This is because the vehicle is a ridged object with no moving parts. They
      also turn slowly taking at least 3 to 5 seconds to make a 90 degree turn. 
      Because vehicles do not go through many difficult appearance changes 
      The tracker can adapt slower which reduces track drift and the filter
      can learn a more consistent appearance model of the vehicle.
      
      One of the most difficult things for the tracker to handle is out-of-plain
      rotations.  This is because the MOSSE Tracker will lock on to the center
      point of the tracking rectangle.  Consider tracking a face where center 
      of the track is initialized on the nose.  As long as the face is looking 
      directly at the camera, the tracker will keep the rectangle centered on 
      the nose.  If the the face turns to the left or right so that a profile
      view is shown, the track will still be centered on the same point on the
      nose.  This is a problem because in the profile view half of the tracking 
      rectangle will be occupied by the background.  The tracker might then 
      adapt to track features of the background instead of the face.    

      B{Initialization Parameters}
      
      There are many optional parameters that can be passed to the C{MOSSETrack} 
      constructor; however, the initial rectangle (C{rect}), the frame rate, C{update_rate}, 
      and C{min_psr} seem to have the most effect on performance.  It is 
      recommended that those parameters should be adjusted first.  
      Documentation on other parameters can be found with the L{constructor<__init__>}.
      
      B{Selecting the Tracking Rectangle} 
      
      One of the biggest factors that effects the performance of the tracker
      is the selection of the tracking rectangle. When tracking, the MOSSE 
      filter will automatically use the highest contrast and most stable edges 
      in the rectangle for tracking. For this reason it is important that the 
      tracking rectangle capture those features.  
      
      As a general rule, tracking works best when the tracking rectangle is 
      approximately square even if the target is not. Additionally, the 
      targets boundary is often one of the best features to track.  Therefore,
      it is good practice for the tracking rectangle to be 15% to 25% larger
      than the target being tracked.
      
      When tracking people this is especially important.  Because the legs 
      move quickly it is often unnecessary to include them in the tracking 
      rectangle.  In practice, the tracker works best when it is initialized
      using a square that is centered on the torso and the size is set such 
      that the square extends to about the knees.  
      
      It is also important that the tracking rectangle be adjusted to account
      for the speed of the target.  A good rule of thumb is that the target
      targets velocity per frame should be about one tenth the width
      of the tracking rectangle. That means if a target moves 10 pixels per 
      frame the rectangle should have dimensions of 100x100 pixels or larger.
      
      B{Frame Rates}
      
      Tracking is easier if the target changes very little per frame.  That 
      means that faster frame rates means better tracking.  For most scenes
      the tracker does well at 10 to 15 fps however 30 fps or better is 
      preferred.
       
      B{Update Rate}
      
      The C{update_rate} controls how fast the tracker adapts to changing 
      appearance of the target.  Typically, the update rate should be set
      somewhere between 0.0 and 0.25.  A value of 0.0 does not allow the 
      filter to adapt at all, while 1.0 would cause the filters appearance 
      to be based solely upon the last frame processed.  For fast changing 
      targets such as football players dodging in and out of traffic the 
      update rate should closer to 0.25 while slowly changing targets such
      as cars should use values closer to 0.03. By default this value is
      set to 0.0625 which works well in many scenarios. The update rate is 
      related to the frame rate in that slower frame will probably require
      faster update rates.
      
      B{Occlusion Detection}
      
      This tracker use the Peak-to-Sidelobe Ratio (PSR) as a way to measure
      track quality and to detect occlusion.  PSR is a measure of the 
      correlation peak strength where higher values indicate more confidence
      that the tracker is operating properly.  When occlusion is detected when
      the PSR drops below a threshold.  This puts the tracker in a state where
      the filter updates and location updates stop and the tracker is waiting 
      for the target to reappear.  If the target reappears and the PSR exceeds
      the threshold then tracking will continue.
      
      The C{min_psr} controls the threshold at which occlusion is detected.
      This is typically set between 6.0 and 10.0 where higher values will
      error on the side rejecting a valid track as a failure and lower values 
      will maintain weak tracks but will be more likely to allow tracking 
      failures and occlusions to go undetected. If this occlusion detection is 
      undesired setting C{min_psr} to 0.0 will disable this feature. 
      
      I{Note: Because the tracker stops updates during occlusion the tracking 
      rectangle will not move.  If the target reappears outside of this 
      rectangle it will not be reaquired.  If the camera is stationary and
      the target moves behind an obstruction this means that the tracking 
      rectangle will not be centered over the target.  It is possible to adjust
      the rectangle center to follow the predicted path of the target 
      using the L{setCenter} method and therefore reaquire targets in this
      scenario.}
